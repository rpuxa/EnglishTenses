I come from a very large family and recently my parents ___________________________ (DECIDE2) that they
___________________________ (SPEND2) long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham. “We
___________________________ (MOVE2) to the country”, my father ___________________________ (ANNOUNCE3) one
evening. “I ___________________________ (SELL1) this house and we ___________________________ (LIVE2) on a farm”.
So last week we ___________________________ (LOAD2) all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few
days we ___________________________ (TRY2) to organise ourselves in our new home. Yesterday, for example, my
two brothers and I ___________________________ (START1) painting the upstairs rooms. Unfortunately, while I
___________________________ (MIX1) the paint, one of my brothers ___________________________ (OPEN2) the door.
Nobody ___________________________ (TELL3) him that we ___________________________ (BE2) in the room. So instead
of painting the walls we ___________________________ (SPEND2) all morning cleaning paint off the floor.
But worse things ___________________________ (HAPPEN2) since then. This morning, when I _______________________
(WAKE1) up, water ___________________________ (DRIP3) through the ceiling next to my bed. We _____________________
(SPEND2) the last five hours repairing the roof. It is not all bad news though. The school in the village nearby
___________________________ (CLOSE3) down two years ago, and my parents ___________________________ (NOT FIND2)
another school for us yet.







I come from a very large family and recently my parents have decided (DECIDE) that they had spent (SPEND)
long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham. “We are moving (MOVE) to the country”, my
father announced (ANNOUNCE) one evening. “I will sell (SELL) this house and we will live (LIVE) on a farm”.
So last week we loaded (LOAD) all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been
trying (TRY) to organise ourselves in our new home. Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started
(START) painting the upstairs rooms. Unfortunately, while I was mixing (MIX) the paint, one of my brothers
opened (OPEN) the door. Nobody told (TELL) him that we were (BE) in the room. So instead of painting the
walls we spent (SPEND) all morning cleaning paint off the floor.
But worse things have happened (HAPPEN) since then. This morning, when I woke (WAKE) up, water was
dripping (DRIP) through the ceiling next to my bed. We have spent (SPEND) the last five hours repairing the
roof. It is not all bad news though. The school in the village nearby closed (CLOSE) down two years ago, and
my parents have not found (NOT FIND) another school for us yet.

term at university. In fact, I _______________________________ (REALLY ENJOY1) myself. I ____________________________

new friends. I _______________________________ (STILL STAY1) with my friend Jill and I ______________________________
(LOOK1) for some place to live on my own. Only a small number of first year students __________________________
(LIVE2) in college here and I ___________________________ (SEEM1) to be spending a lot of time travelling.
I _______________________________ (ATTEND1) lectures every morning, and most afternoons I _______________________
(STUDY1) in the library. In fact, I _______________________________ (WRITE1) this letter right now instead of an essay
on Shakespeare.
I think I’ll buy some new clothes with the money you have sent me. Everything ___________________________ (COST3)
a lot here, and I _______________________________ (SAVE1) to buy a coat for the winter months. It ___________________
(GET3) really cold here in the evenings.
I now _______________________________ (KNOW1) some other students and we ____________________________ (HAVE2)
quite a good time. I _______________________________ (ALSO LEARN1) to drive. University students _________________
(GET2) a refund if they take their tests here. I _______________________________ (LOOK1) forward to coming home
next month. See you soon.
