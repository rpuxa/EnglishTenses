 “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#GERMAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#GERMAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#GERMAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#GERMAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#GERMAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#GERMAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#GERMAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#GERMAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#GERMAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#GERMAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have

their tests here.#539#GERMAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#GERMAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#GERMAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#GERMAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#GERMAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#GERMAN   They simply do not care#545#GERMAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#GERMAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue

collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#GERMAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#GERMAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#GERMAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#GERMAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#GERMAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#GERMAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#GERMAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#GERMAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#GERMAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#GERMAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#GERMAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#GERMAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#GERMAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#GERMAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#GERMAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#GERMAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#GERMAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#GERMAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#GERMAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#GERMAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#GERMAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#GERMAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#NORWEGIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#NORWEGIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#NORWEGIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#NORWEGIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#NORWEGIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#NORWEGIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#NORWEGIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#NORWEGIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#NORWEGIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#NORWEGIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#NORWEGIAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#NORWEGIAN   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#NORWEGIAN   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#NORWEGIAN   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#NORWEGIAN   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot

looking forward to coming home next month.#540#NORWEGIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#NORWEGIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#NORWEGIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#NORWEGIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#NORWEGIAN   They simply do not care#545#NORWEGIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#NORWEGIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue

He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#NORWEGIAN   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#NORWEGIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#NORWEGIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#NORWEGIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#NORWEGIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#NORWEGIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#NORWEGIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#NORWEGIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#NORWEGIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#NORWEGIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#NORWEGIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#NORWEGIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#NORWEGIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#NORWEGIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#NORWEGIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#NORWEGIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#NORWEGIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#NORWEGIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#NORWEGIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#NORWEGIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#NORWEGIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#NORWEGIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#NORWEGIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#NORWEGIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

homework tonight.#513#RUSSIAN   I will not be jogging this evening because I’m sick.#514#RUSSIAN   The minister will not be speaking today, his plans changed.#515#RUSSIAN   I come from a very large family and recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#RUSSIAN   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#RUSSIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#RUSSIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#RUSSIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#RUSSIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#RUSSIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#RUSSIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#RUSSIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#RUSSIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#RUSSIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#RUSSIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#RUSSIAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#RUSSIAN   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#RUSSIAN   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#RUSSIAN   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#RUSSIAN   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#RUSSIAN   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#RUSSIAN   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#RUSSIAN   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#RUSSIAN   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#RUSSIAN   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#RUSSIAN   I am also learning to drive.#538#RUSSIAN   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#RUSSIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#RUSSIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#RUSSIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#RUSSIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#RUSSIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#RUSSIAN   They simply do not care#545#RUSSIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#RUSSIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#RUSSIAN   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#RUSSIAN   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#RUSSIAN   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#RUSSIAN   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#RUSSIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#RUSSIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#RUSSIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#RUSSIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#RUSSIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#RUSSIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#RUSSIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#RUSSIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#RUSSIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#RUSSIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#RUSSIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#RUSSIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#RUSSIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#RUSSIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#RUSSIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#RUSSIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#RUSSIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#RUSSIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#RUSSIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#RUSSIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#RUSSIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#RUSSIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#RUSSIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#FINNISH   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#FINNISH   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#FINNISH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#FINNISH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#FINNISH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#FINNISH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#FINNISH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#FINNISH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#FINNISH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the

  University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#FINNISH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#FINNISH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#FINNISH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#FINNISH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#FINNISH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the

he was seven.#551#FINNISH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#FINNISH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#FINNISH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#FINNISH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#FINNISH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#FINNISH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#FINNISH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#FINNISH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#FINNISH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#FINNISH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#FINNISH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#FINNISH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#FINNISH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#FINNISH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#FINNISH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#FINNISH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#FINNISH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#FINNISH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#FINNISH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#FINNISH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#FINNISH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#FINNISH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#FINNISH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#PORTUGUESE   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#PORTUGUESE   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#PORTUGUESE   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#PORTUGUESE   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#PORTUGUESE   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#PORTUGUESE   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#PORTUGUESE   But worse things have happened since then.#524#PORTUGUESE   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#PORTUGUESE   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#PORTUGUESE   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents

here.#539#PORTUGUESE   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#PORTUGUESE   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#PORTUGUESE   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#PORTUGUESE   For example, town authorities are building a

seven.#551#PORTUGUESE   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#PORTUGUESE   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#PORTUGUESE   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#PORTUGUESE   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#PORTUGUESE   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#PORTUGUESE   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#PORTUGUESE   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#PORTUGUESE   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do

After some time, the bus stopped#562#PORTUGUESE   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#PORTUGUESE   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#PORTUGUESE   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#PORTUGUESE   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#PORTUGUESE   He began his diet a week ago.#567#PORTUGUESE   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#PORTUGUESE   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#PORTUGUESE   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#PORTUGUESE   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#PORTUGUESE   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#PORTUGUESE   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#PORTUGUESE   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#BULGARIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#BULGARIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#BULGARIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#BULGARIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#BULGARIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#BULGARIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#BULGARIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#BULGARIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#BULGARIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#BULGARIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found

looking forward to coming home next month.#540#BULGARIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#BULGARIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#BULGARIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#BULGARIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#BULGARIAN   They simply do not care#545#BULGARIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#BULGARIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue

school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#BULGARIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#BULGARIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#BULGARIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#BULGARIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#BULGARIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#BULGARIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#BULGARIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#BULGARIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#BULGARIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#BULGARIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#BULGARIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#BULGARIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#BULGARIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#BULGARIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#BULGARIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#BULGARIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#BULGARIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#BULGARIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#BULGARIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#BULGARIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#BULGARIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#BULGARIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#LITHUANIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#LITHUANIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#LITHUANIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#LITHUANIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#LITHUANIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#LITHUANIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#LITHUANIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#LITHUANIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#LITHUANIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#LITHUANIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents

here.#539#LITHUANIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#LITHUANIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#LITHUANIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#LITHUANIAN   For example, town authorities are building a

They simply do not care#545#LITHUANIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#LITHUANIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this

seven.#551#LITHUANIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#LITHUANIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#LITHUANIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#LITHUANIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#LITHUANIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#LITHUANIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#LITHUANIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#LITHUANIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do

After some time, the bus stopped#562#LITHUANIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#LITHUANIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#LITHUANIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#LITHUANIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#LITHUANIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#LITHUANIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#LITHUANIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#LITHUANIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#LITHUANIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#LITHUANIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#LITHUANIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#LITHUANIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

family and recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#LATVIAN   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#LATVIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#LATVIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#LATVIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#LATVIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#LATVIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#LATVIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#LATVIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#LATVIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#LATVIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#LATVIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#LATVIAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#LATVIAN   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#LATVIAN   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#LATVIAN   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#LATVIAN   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#LATVIAN   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#LATVIAN   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#LATVIAN   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#LATVIAN   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#LATVIAN   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#LATVIAN   I am also learning to drive.#538#LATVIAN   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#LATVIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#LATVIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#LATVIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#LATVIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#LATVIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#LATVIAN   They simply do not care#545#LATVIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#LATVIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#LATVIAN   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#LATVIAN   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#LATVIAN   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#LATVIAN   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#LATVIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#LATVIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#LATVIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#LATVIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#LATVIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#LATVIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#LATVIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#LATVIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#LATVIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#LATVIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#LATVIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#LATVIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#LATVIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#LATVIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#LATVIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#LATVIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#LATVIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#LATVIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#LATVIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#LATVIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#LATVIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#LATVIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#LATVIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

large family and recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#CROATIAN   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#CROATIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#CROATIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#CROATIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#CROATIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#CROATIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#CROATIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#CROATIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#CROATIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#CROATIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#CROATIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#CROATIAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#CROATIAN   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#CROATIAN   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#CROATIAN   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#CROATIAN   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#CROATIAN   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#CROATIAN   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#CROATIAN   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#CROATIAN   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#CROATIAN   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#CROATIAN   I am also learning to drive.#538#CROATIAN   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#CROATIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#CROATIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#CROATIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#CROATIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#CROATIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#CROATIAN   They simply do not care#545#CROATIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#CROATIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#CROATIAN   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#CROATIAN   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#CROATIAN   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#CROATIAN   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#CROATIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#CROATIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#CROATIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#CROATIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#CROATIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#CROATIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#CROATIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#CROATIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#CROATIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#CROATIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#CROATIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#CROATIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#CROATIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#CROATIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#CROATIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#CROATIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#CROATIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#CROATIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#CROATIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#CROATIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#CROATIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#CROATIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#CROATIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#HUNGARIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#HUNGARIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#HUNGARIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#HUNGARIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip

on.#569#HUNGARIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#HUNGARIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#HUNGARIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#HUNGARIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#HUNGARIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#SLOVAK   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#SLOVAK   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#SLOVAK   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#SLOVAK   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#SLOVAK   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#SLOVAK   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#SLOVAK   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#SLOVAK   But worse things have happened since then.#524#SLOVAK   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#SLOVAK   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#SLOVAK   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#SLOVAK   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#SLOVAK   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#SLOVAK   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#SLOVAK   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#SLOVAK   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#SLOVAK   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#SLOVAK   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#SLOVAK   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#SLOVAK   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#SLOVAK   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#SLOVAK   I am also learning to drive.#538#SLOVAK   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#SLOVAK   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#SLOVAK   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#SLOVAK   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#SLOVAK   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#SLOVAK   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#SLOVAK   They simply do not care#545#SLOVAK   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#SLOVAK   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#SLOVAK   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#SLOVAK   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#SLOVAK   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#SLOVAK   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#SLOVAK   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#SLOVAK   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#SLOVAK   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#SLOVAK   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#SLOVAK   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#SLOVAK   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#SLOVAK   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#SLOVAK   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#SLOVAK   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#SLOVAK   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#SLOVAK   After some time, the bus stopped#562#SLOVAK   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#SLOVAK   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#SLOVAK   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#SLOVAK   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#SLOVAK   He began his diet a week ago.#567#SLOVAK   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#SLOVAK   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#SLOVAK   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#SLOVAK   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#SLOVAK   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#SLOVAK   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#SLOVAK   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

plans changed.#515#SLOVENIAN   I come from a very large family and recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#SLOVENIAN   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#SLOVENIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#SLOVENIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#SLOVENIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#SLOVENIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#SLOVENIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#SLOVENIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#SLOVENIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#SLOVENIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#SLOVENIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#SLOVENIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#SLOVENIAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#SLOVENIAN   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#SLOVENIAN   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#SLOVENIAN   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#SLOVENIAN   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#SLOVENIAN   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#SLOVENIAN   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#SLOVENIAN   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#SLOVENIAN   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#SLOVENIAN   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#SLOVENIAN   I am also learning to drive.#538#SLOVENIAN   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#SLOVENIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#SLOVENIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#SLOVENIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#SLOVENIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#SLOVENIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#SLOVENIAN   They simply do not care#545#SLOVENIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#SLOVENIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#SLOVENIAN   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#SLOVENIAN   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#SLOVENIAN

school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#SLOVENIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#SLOVENIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#SLOVENIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#SLOVENIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#SLOVENIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#SLOVENIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#SLOVENIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#SLOVENIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#SLOVENIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#SLOVENIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#SLOVENIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#SLOVENIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#SLOVENIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#SLOVENIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#SLOVENIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#SLOVENIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#SLOVENIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#SLOVENIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#SLOVENIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#SLOVENIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#SLOVENIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#SLOVENIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#SERBIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#SERBIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#SERBIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#SERBIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#SERBIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#SERBIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#SERBIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#SERBIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#SERBIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the

  University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#SERBIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#SERBIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#SERBIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#SERBIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#SERBIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the

he was seven.#551#SERBIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#SERBIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#SERBIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#SERBIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#SERBIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#SERBIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#SERBIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#SERBIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#SERBIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#SERBIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#SERBIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#SERBIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#SERBIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#SERBIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#SERBIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#SERBIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#SERBIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#SERBIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#SERBIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#SERBIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#SERBIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#SERBIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#SERBIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#SWEDISH   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#SWEDISH   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#SWEDISH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#SWEDISH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#SWEDISH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#SWEDISH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#SWEDISH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#SWEDISH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#SWEDISH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the

  University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#SWEDISH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#SWEDISH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#SWEDISH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#SWEDISH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#SWEDISH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the

he was seven.#551#SWEDISH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#SWEDISH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#SWEDISH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#SWEDISH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#SWEDISH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#SWEDISH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#SWEDISH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#SWEDISH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#SWEDISH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#SWEDISH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#SWEDISH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#SWEDISH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#SWEDISH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#SWEDISH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#SWEDISH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#SWEDISH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#SWEDISH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#SWEDISH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#SWEDISH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#SWEDISH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#SWEDISH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#SWEDISH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#SWEDISH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

years!#510#GREEK   Let’s meet at the park tomorrow, I will be walking with my dog from 9 to 9:30#511#GREEK   Don’t call me after ten, I will be sleeping#512#GREEK   I will not be doing my homework tonight.#513#GREEK   I will not be jogging this evening because I’m sick.#514#GREEK   The minister will not be speaking today, his plans changed.#515#GREEK   I come from a very large family and recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#GREEK   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#GREEK   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#GREEK   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#GREEK   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#GREEK   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#GREEK   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#GREEK   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#GREEK   But worse things have happened since then.#524#GREEK   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#GREEK   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#GREEK   The school in

here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#GREEK   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#GREEK   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#GREEK   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#GREEK   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#GREEK   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#GREEK   I am also learning to drive.#538#GREEK   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#GREEK   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#GREEK   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#GREEK   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#GREEK   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#GREEK   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#GREEK   They simply do not care#545#GREEK   In fact,

all over the world.#552#GREEK   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#GREEK   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#GREEK   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#GREEK   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#GREEK   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#GREEK   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#GREEK   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#GREEK   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#GREEK   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#GREEK   After some time, the bus stopped#562#GREEK   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#GREEK   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#GREEK   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#GREEK   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#GREEK   He began his diet a week ago.#567#GREEK   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#GREEK   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#GREEK   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#GREEK   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#GREEK   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#GREEK   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#GREEK   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#ITALIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#ITALIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#ITALIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#ITALIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#ITALIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#ITALIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#ITALIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#ITALIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#ITALIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#ITALIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#ITALIAN   I am just writing to tell you how much I

  University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#ITALIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#ITALIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#ITALIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#ITALIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#ITALIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#ITALIAN   They simply do not care#545#ITALIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#ITALIAN   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday

he was seven.#551#ITALIAN   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#ITALIAN   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#ITALIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#ITALIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#ITALIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#ITALIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#ITALIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#ITALIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#ITALIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#ITALIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#ITALIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#ITALIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#ITALIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#ITALIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#ITALIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#ITALIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#ITALIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#ITALIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#ITALIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#ITALIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#ITALIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#ITALIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#ITALIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

organise ourselves in our new home.#519#SPANISH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#SPANISH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#SPANISH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#SPANISH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#SPANISH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#SPANISH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#SPANISH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#SPANISH   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#SPANISH   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#SPANISH   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#SPANISH   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#SPANISH   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#SPANISH   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#SPANISH   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#SPANISH   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#SPANISH   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#SPANISH   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#SPANISH   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#SPANISH   I am also learning to drive.#538#SPANISH   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#SPANISH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#SPANISH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#SPANISH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#SPANISH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#SPANISH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#SPANISH   They simply do not care#545#SPANISH   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#SPANISH   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#SPANISH   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#SPANISH   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#SPANISH   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#SPANISH   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#SPANISH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#SPANISH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#SPANISH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#SPANISH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#SPANISH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#SPANISH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#SPANISH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#SPANISH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#SPANISH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#SPANISH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#SPANISH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#SPANISH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#SPANISH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#SPANISH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#SPANISH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#SPANISH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#SPANISH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#SPANISH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#SPANISH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#SPANISH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#SPANISH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#SPANISH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#SPANISH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#ESTONIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#ESTONIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying

changing before my eyes.#542#ESTONIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#ESTONIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do

tracks.#554#ESTONIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#ESTONIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#ESTONIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#ESTONIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#ESTONIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I

countryside.#561#ESTONIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#ESTONIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#ESTONIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#ESTONIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#ESTONIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#ESTONIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#ESTONIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#ESTONIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#ESTONIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#ESTONIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#ESTONIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#ESTONIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#ESTONIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#CZECH   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#CZECH   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#CZECH   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#CZECH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#CZECH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#CZECH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#CZECH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#CZECH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#CZECH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#CZECH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#CZECH   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#CZECH   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#CZECH   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#CZECH   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#CZECH   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#CZECH   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#CZECH   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#CZECH   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#CZECH   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#CZECH   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#CZECH   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#CZECH   I am also learning to drive.#538#CZECH   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#CZECH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#CZECH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#CZECH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#CZECH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#CZECH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#CZECH   They simply do not care#545#CZECH   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#CZECH   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#CZECH   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#CZECH   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#CZECH   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#CZECH   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#CZECH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#CZECH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#CZECH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#CZECH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#CZECH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#CZECH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#CZECH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#CZECH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#CZECH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#CZECH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#CZECH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#CZECH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#CZECH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#CZECH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#CZECH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#CZECH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#CZECH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#CZECH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#CZECH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#CZECH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#CZECH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#CZECH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#CZECH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

our new home.#519#POLISH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#POLISH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#POLISH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#POLISH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#POLISH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#POLISH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#POLISH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#POLISH   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#POLISH   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#POLISH   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#POLISH   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#POLISH   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#POLISH   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#POLISH   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#POLISH   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#POLISH   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#POLISH   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#POLISH   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#POLISH   I am also learning to drive.#538#POLISH   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#POLISH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#POLISH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#POLISH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#POLISH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#POLISH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#POLISH   They simply do not care#545#POLISH   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#POLISH   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#POLISH   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#POLISH   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#POLISH   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#POLISH   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#POLISH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#POLISH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#POLISH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#POLISH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#POLISH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#POLISH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#POLISH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#POLISH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#POLISH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#POLISH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#POLISH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#POLISH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#POLISH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#POLISH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#POLISH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#POLISH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#POLISH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#POLISH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#POLISH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#POLISH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#POLISH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#POLISH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#POLISH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#ROMANIAN   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#ROMANIAN   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#ROMANIAN   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#ROMANIAN   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#ROMANIAN   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#ROMANIAN   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#ROMANIAN   But worse things have happened since then.#524#ROMANIAN   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#ROMANIAN   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#ROMANIAN   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#ROMANIAN   I am just writing to tell you how

learning to drive.#538#ROMANIAN   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#ROMANIAN   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#ROMANIAN   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#ROMANIAN   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#ROMANIAN   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#ROMANIAN   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#ROMANIAN   They simply do not care#545#ROMANIAN   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#ROMANIAN   I am

one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#ROMANIAN   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#ROMANIAN   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#ROMANIAN   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#ROMANIAN   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#ROMANIAN   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#ROMANIAN   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#ROMANIAN   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#ROMANIAN   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#ROMANIAN   After some time, the bus stopped#562#ROMANIAN   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#ROMANIAN   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#ROMANIAN   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#ROMANIAN   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#ROMANIAN   He began his diet a week ago.#567#ROMANIAN   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#ROMANIAN   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#ROMANIAN   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#ROMANIAN   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#ROMANIAN   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#ROMANIAN   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#ROMANIAN   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

 “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#DANISH   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#DANISH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#DANISH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#DANISH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#DANISH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#DANISH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#DANISH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#DANISH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#DANISH

their tests here.#539#DANISH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#DANISH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#DANISH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#DANISH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#DANISH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#DANISH   They simply do not care#545#DANISH   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#DANISH   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue

collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#DANISH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#DANISH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#DANISH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#DANISH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#DANISH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#DANISH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#DANISH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#DANISH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#DANISH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#DANISH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#DANISH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#DANISH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#DANISH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#DANISH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#DANISH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#DANISH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#DANISH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#DANISH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#DANISH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#DANISH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#DANISH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#DANISH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

evening.#517#TURKISH   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#TURKISH   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#TURKISH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#TURKISH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#TURKISH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#TURKISH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#TURKISH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#TURKISH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#TURKISH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the

  University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#TURKISH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#TURKISH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#TURKISH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#TURKISH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#TURKISH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the

he was seven.#551#TURKISH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#TURKISH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#TURKISH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#TURKISH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#TURKISH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#TURKISH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#TURKISH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#TURKISH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#TURKISH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#TURKISH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#TURKISH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#TURKISH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#TURKISH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#TURKISH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#TURKISH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#TURKISH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#TURKISH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#TURKISH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#TURKISH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#TURKISH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#TURKISH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#TURKISH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#TURKISH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",

recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.#516#DUTCH   “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.#517#DUTCH   “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”#518#DUTCH   So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.#519#DUTCH   Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.#520#DUTCH   Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.#521#DUTCH   Nobody told him that we were in the room.#522#DUTCH   So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.#523#DUTCH   But worse things have happened since then.#524#DUTCH   This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.#525#DUTCH   We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.#526#DUTCH   The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.#527#DUTCH   I am just writing to tell you how much I appreciate the money you have sent me, and to tell you how I am getting on in my first term at university.#528#DUTCH   In fact, I am really enjoying myself.#529#DUTCH   I am studying quite hard as well, but at the moment I am spending a lot of time making new friends.#530#DUTCH   I am still staying with my friend Jill and I am looking for some place to live on my own.#531#DUTCH   Only a small number of first year students live in college here and I seem to be spending a lot of time travelling.#532#DUTCH   I attend lectures every morning, and most afternoons I study in the library.#533#DUTCH   In fact, I am writing this letter right now instead of an essay on Shakespeare.#534#DUTCH   Everything costs a lot here, and I am saving to buy a coat for the winter months.#535#DUTCH   It gets really cold here in the evenings.#536#DUTCH   I now know some other students and we are having quite a good time.#537#DUTCH   I am also learning to drive.#538#DUTCH   University students get a refund if they take their tests here.#539#DUTCH   I am looking forward to coming home next month.#540#DUTCH   I am writing this letter because it seems to me that far too many changes are taking place in my country these days, and, as a result, we are losing our identity.#541#DUTCH   I live in a small town but even this town is changing before my eyes.#542#DUTCH   For example, town authorities are building a burger place where my favourite restaurant used to be.#543#DUTCH   Our culture belongs to everybody, and I do not understand why the town leaders are not doing to preserve it.#544#DUTCH   They simply do not care#545#DUTCH   In fact, I am thinking of starting an action group.#546#DUTCH   I am appearing on a TV show on Friday evening to make people aware of how importance this issue is.#547#DUTCH   It’s time for us to start doing something before it gets too late.#548#DUTCH   He first saw a train when he was five years old and he was absolutely fascinated.#549#DUTCH   He goes to a different train station every week and writes down the engine number of every train he sees.#550#DUTCH   He has been doing this since he was seven.#551#DUTCH   By the time he left school he had collected over 5000 different engine numbers from all over the world.#552#DUTCH   At one time, while he was standing at a station he saw something very strange.#553#DUTCH   He had been waiting for a train for an hour when he suddenly saw an old steam locomotive coming down the tracks.#554#DUTCH   It did not stop at the station and when it passed Herbie saw that all the passengers were wearing old-fashioned clothes.#555#DUTCH   He told the station manager about this, but the manager said that no steam locomotive had passed through the station for years, and that the last one had crashed , killing everyone on board.#556#DUTCH   I love travelling in the country, but I do not like losing my way.#557#DUTCH   I went on a trip the other day, but my trip took me longer than I had expected#558#DUTCH   Im going to Woodford Green’, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I do not know where it is.#559#DUTCH   -I will tell you where to get off, answered the conductor.#560#DUTCH   I sat in front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.#561#DUTCH   After some time, the bus stopped#562#DUTCH   I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.#563#DUTCH   You must get off here, the conductor said, This is as far as we go.#564#DUTCH   We are going back now, said the conductor.#565#DUTCH   My friend, Herbert, has always been fat, but things have got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.#566#DUTCH   He began his diet a week ago.#567#DUTCH   First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.#568#DUTCH   The list included most of the food he loved : butter, potatoes, rice, beer milk , chocolate, sweets and so on.#569#DUTCH   Yesterday, I paid him a visit.#570#DUTCH   I rang the bell and was not surprised to see Herbert as fat as ever.#571#DUTCH   He led me to his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.#572#DUTCH   When I asked him what he was doing he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.#573#DUTCH   He showed me the contents of the parcel.#",
