515. I come from a very large family and recently my parents have decided that they had spent long enough living in an overcrowded house in Birmingham.
516. “We are moving to the country”, my father announced one evening.
517. “I will sell this house and we will live on a farm”
518. So last week we loaded all our belongings into two hired vans, and for the last few days we have been trying to organise ourselves in our new home.
519. Yesterday, for example, my two brothers and I started painting the upstairs rooms.
520. Unfortunately, while I was mixing the paint, one of my brothers opened the door.
521. Nobody told him that we were in the room.
522. So instead of painting the walls we spent all morning cleaning paint off the floor.
523. But worse things have happened since then.
524. This morning, when I woke up, water was dripping through the ceiling next to my bed.
525. We have spent the last five hours repairing the roof.
526. The school in the village nearby closed down two years ago, and my parents have not found another school for us yet.

528. In fact, I am really enjoying myself.
